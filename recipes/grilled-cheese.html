        <p>The sweet and salty combination of this sandwich makes it feel absolutely extravagant to eat, despite it being such a simple recipe! 
        Prep time can be reduced by pre-cutting apples, keeping softened butter, and mixing salad dressing ahead of time.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sharp Cheddar Cheese (or cheese of your choice)</li>
            <li>Choice of Apple (I like Honeycrisp or Pink Lady apples for this recipe)</li>
            <li>Sourdough Bread</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Slice enough cheese to fit on your bread.</li>
            <li>Slice apples to fit bread.</li>
            <li>Mix softened butter with honey until it's well blended and easy to spread.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet up on the stove.</li>
            <li>Spread your honey butter on the outside AND inside of your first piece of bread.</li>
            <li>Lay buttered bread in the skillet, quickly layering cheese and apples.</li>
            <li>Quickly spread honey butter on both sides of your top piece of bread and add it.</li>
            <li>Flip your sandwich carefully once you see the cheese starting to soften.</li>
        </ul>
